I am currently a Graduate student at the University of Washington, Seattle, pursuing a masters in 
Mechanical Engineering. My interests are centered around imitation learning, out of distribution detection, and control theory for 
Robotics. My objective is to develop adaptive robots capable of navigating and performing high level tasks in complex environments effectively.
